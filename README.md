# Simulating-Human-in-the-Loop-Optimization

This repository contains the data and code to replicate the simulated human-in-the-loop optimizations from our paper: "Simulating human-in-the-loop optimization of an ankle exoskeleton to compare optimiztion algorithm performance". *add link*
We have tested this repository works with Python 3.7 and the following package versions. We recommend these installation commands in this order:
pip install -q bayesian-optimization==1.2.0
pip install -q cma
pip install -q numpy==1.18.5
pip install -q scipy==1.4.1
pip install -q scikit-learn==0.22.2.post1
